        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Fringe Benefits Application is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to streamline the
          management of employee fringe benefits within an organization.
          Fringe benefits are forms of compensation provided to employees or related parties in
          addition to regular wages. These benefits can take many forms—such as event tickets,
          travel, club memberships, or reimbursements for certain expenses—and are considered part
          of the overall value an individual receives from the university.<br>Users can properly report taxable fringe
          benefits in compliance with IRS regulations. It provides a user-friendly interface for departments to view and
          manage benefits for employees, while also offering administrative tools for Payroll to oversee and allocate
          resources effectively.

      <section class="project-problem">
        <h2>Problem Addressed</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional fringe benefits management often involves manual processes, paper forms, and disparate systems
          that can lead to compliance risks. This process was carried out on paper forms. By outlining consistent
          steps and responsibilities, the procedure helps ensure that all benefits provided beyond
          standard wages are handled accurately and transparently, supporting both institutional
          accountability and federal compliance.

      <section class="project-features">
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Home screen:</strong> Departments can submit fringe benefit requests for employees using this
            page. The form has many dependent dropdowns, and data is stored in JSON.</li>
          <li><strong>History screen:</strong> The Fringe Benefits form History screen shows request id, grantor department, department
contact, employee name, benefit type, date submitted, status, and taxability. It also allows the user to filter the list of submissions.
The History tab at the top of the screen lets departmental users view all form submissions
within their fund-org security access. It is a helpful place to check the status of each form
and see the taxability determination for each fringe benefit.
